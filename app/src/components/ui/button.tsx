   * `render` instead — "New skill", "New agent", the sidebar's new-channel control, the two
   * empty-state returns, and `PageShell`'s back button, which is five routes in every state each of
   * them has — and every one of them warned at render that it had been told to expect a native
   * button and found an anchor. It was not only noise: Base UI was putting `type="button"` on an
   * anchor, which means nothing there, and withholding the `role="button"` and Space-to-activate
   * handling a non-button needs in order to behave like one.
   *
   * Replacing the element is exactly the case where the default is wrong, so the default follows
   * `render`, once here rather than at every call site. Passing `render` is not proof the result is
   * a non-button, only that we can no longer assume it is one, so a call site drawing a real
   * `<button>` through `render` passes `nativeButton` back explicitly — `combobox.tsx` is the one
   * that does.
